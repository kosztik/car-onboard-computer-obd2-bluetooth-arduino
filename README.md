# Car onboard computer with arduino


With this Arduino project, I will try to make some useful calculations and show it when I drive.

these are:
- short term consumption in L/100km
- "long" term consumption in L/100km - in fact this is not too long, but it will change in the future
- speed in km/h 
- Fuel in the tank (L)
- predicted km based on remaining fuel

The details about the used hardware see the wiki pages.
